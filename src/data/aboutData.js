export const bio = `Growing up, all I wanted to do was play video games. At some point around 13, curiosity got the better of me — I wanted to understand how they were made, how things worked under the hood. So I started tinkering. What began as a kid trying to figure out how games are built slowly turned into a genuine love for building software. Almost a decade later, that same curiosity is still what drives me.

These days, the work spans a lot further than I ever expected it to. From e-commerce platforms and AI-driven products to full-stack education tools and enterprise backends — there's been no shortage of problems to solve. What I enjoy most is the variety. One week it's a React frontend, the next it's optimising an AI pipeline or designing a database from scratch. Every project teaches me something new, and honestly, that's what keeps it exciting.

Balance is something I care about deeply. Being stuck on a chair for eight hours a day, only to go home and do it for eight more — that's not a life that appeals to me. So I make a point not to live like that. Training Muay Thai and MMA regularly is what keeps me grounded. It clears my head, gives me energy, and builds the kind of discipline that carries over into everything else. Mixing development with sports lets my brain breathe and flourish in areas beyond just code — and I genuinely think it makes me a better developer because of it.

That mindset shapes how I approach my work, too. Rather than grinding through burnout and chasing deadlines at 3am, I try to stay consistent, work with intention, and build habits that actually sustain the output over time. Nothing flashy — just showing up, doing good work, and getting better at it every day.`
