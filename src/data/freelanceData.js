        text: "Full-stack web applications — from single-page marketing sites to complex, data-driven platforms with authentication, payments, dashboards, and real-time features. I work across the entire stack: React and Next.js on the frontend, Node.js or Spring Boot on the backend, and PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Firebase for data. If you have a product idea, I can take it from a blank repo to a deployed, production-ready application.",

        heading: "## How I work",
        text: "I don't disappear for two weeks and come back with something you didn't ask for. I work in short, visible cycles — you'll see progress early and often, and you'll have the chance to steer the direction at every step. I write clean, well-structured code that you or any other developer can pick up and maintain after I'm done. No spaghetti, no shortcuts, no tech debt landmines waiting to go off six months later.",
      },

        heading: "## Why me over a bigger agency",
        text: "With an agency, you're paying for project managers, account reps, and overhead — and your actual work gets passed down to a junior anyway. With me, you're talking directly to the person writing the code. I've shipped real products for real clients — an e-commerce platform for Aromatica Bulgaria, a full-stack AI education tool for Studify AI — and I've built production-grade systems at Bitmovin, where I optimised AI pipelines that cut costs by 37%. You get high-tier output at a fraction of the cost, without the bureaucracy.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## What you get at the end",
        text: "A fully deployed, responsive, and performant application — hosted, documented, and ready to scale. I also handle domain setup, CI/CD pipelines, and post-launch support if you need it. You own everything. No lock-in, no proprietary nonsense. Just clean code and a working product.",

        text: "Complete visual identities and user interfaces — logos, colour systems, typography, component libraries, and fully interactive prototypes. Whether you're building a new product from scratch or refreshing something that's grown stale, I'll create a design language that's cohesive, modern, and unmistakably yours.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## My approach to design",
        text: "I design from the user's perspective first, not the client's ego. Every layout, colour choice, and interaction is informed by how people actually use software — not by what looks flashy in a Dribbble shot. I wireframe early, prototype often, and validate before committing to pixels. The result is an interface that feels effortless to use, because the hard thinking happened before a single line of CSS was written.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## Designer and developer in one",
        text: "Most designers hand off a Figma file and wish you luck. I build what I design. That means zero translation loss between the mockup and the final product — every spacing value, animation curve, and responsive breakpoint lands exactly as intended. You're not paying two people to miscommunicate. You're paying one person who owns the entire pipeline from concept to deployment.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## What the deliverables look like",
        text: "Depending on your needs: a full Figma design system with components and tokens, a brand guidelines document, or a fully implemented frontend ready to connect to your backend. I tailor the output to your situation — if you have a dev team, I'll hand off assets they can run with. If you don't, I'll just build it myself.",

        text: "Founders, small teams, and non-technical stakeholders who need honest, practical technical guidance before making decisions that are expensive to reverse. If you're choosing a tech stack, planning an architecture, evaluating a contractor's work, or trying to figure out why your development is stalling — that's where I come in.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## What I bring to the table",
        text: "I've worked across the full spectrum — enterprise backends at Kirova OOD, AI-driven pipelines at Bitmovin, frontend-heavy client projects, and my own personal builds. I know what scales, what breaks, and what's a waste of time. I won't recommend a microservices architecture for your MVP, and I won't tell you to use Kubernetes when a single VPS would do the job. My advice is grounded in real experience, not hype cycles.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## How the engagement works",
        text: "We start with a call where you walk me through what you're building, where you are, and where you're stuck. I'll ask the questions your team might not be asking — about scalability, security, maintainability, and cost. Then I'll give you a clear, written breakdown of my recommendations with reasoning for each one. No fluff, no filler, no 40-page slide deck. Just actionable guidance you can move on immediately.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## Why I'm worth listening to",
        text: "I'm still a student, which means I'm actively learning and building every single day. I'm not coasting on knowledge from a decade ago — I know what tools are actually good right now, what the community has moved on from, and what's genuinely worth adopting versus what's just trendy. Combine that with real production experience across multiple domains, and you get advice that's both current and battle-tested.",

        text: "Anyone who wants to learn software development — from teenagers writing their first lines of code to university students struggling with coursework to career switchers breaking into tech. I work with complete beginners and intermediate developers alike. If you're motivated and willing to put in the work, I'll meet you where you are.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## Why I'm the right coach",
        text: "I've been coding since I was 13 — I remember exactly what it's like to stare at a screen with no idea what's going wrong. Most senior developers have completely forgotten that feeling, and it shows in how they teach. I haven't forgotten. I'm also still a student myself, which means I understand the struggles younger learners face first-hand. I know what's confusing about textbooks, what bootcamps get wrong, and what actually clicks when someone takes the time to explain it properly.",

        heading: "## How the sessions work",
        text: "One-on-one, live sessions tailored entirely to you. No pre-recorded videos, no generic curriculum. We work on what you need — whether that's understanding how loops work, building your first React app, preparing for a technical interview, or debugging a project that's falling apart. I adapt to your pace, your learning style, and your goals. Some people want structured lessons. Others just want someone to pair-program with and ask questions. Both are fine.",
      },
      {
        heading: "## What makes this different from a course",
        text: "Courses are one-size-fits-all. They can't answer your questions, they can't adjust when you're lost, and they definitely can't look at your code and tell you exactly where you went wrong. I can. You get real-time feedback, a patient explanation when something doesn't make sense, and someone who genuinely cares whether you actually learn — not just whether you finished the module. I've been in your shoes recently enough to know what actually helps.",
